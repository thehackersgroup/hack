# When Crowd Meets Elavators

## Challenge
Make use of sensor data from phones to infer activity patterns

## Method
Classify short and simple patterns in measured data into primitives, then use them to identify complex sequences of activities

### Data
* Three axes of acceleration
* Barometric pressure
* Three axes of rotation [not yet used]
* Three axes of magnetic field [not yet used]
* __Heart rate [not yet used]__

### Primitives
* Resting
* Movement
** Walking
** Running
* Elavator
** Change in elavation
** Starting
** Stopping
